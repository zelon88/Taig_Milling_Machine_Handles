# Taig_Milling_Machine_Handles
In this repo you will find a set of axis control handles that can be attached to Taig milling machines to allow for manual operation of the machine. Replaces electronic stepper motors with analog handles. Allows the  operator of the machine to control the axis' by hand. 

Along with the original source code files in .scad format you will also find renderings of each component and detailed 3D printing, manufacturing & assembly instructions.

# Features
* Handles are optional and modular. Will function properly with any number of handles from 0-4.
* Set screws are located to maximize holding strength and material thickness around the hub.
* Handles are hollow for minimal mass and filament consumption, but still thick enough to survive being thrown around.
* Circular design is less likely to snag on clothing or interfere with nearby work.
* High quality design with real documentation.

# Component Description
* TMMH-001 is the center disk that all other components attach to.
* TMMH-002 is the handle that the operator uses to control the orientation of the center disk, and the axis of the machine.
* TMMH-003 is a washer that slides over the pin of the handle to reduce friction during rotation of the handle.
* TMMH-004 is a washer that secures a handle assembly to the center disk.
* TMMH-005 is an assembled model of one complete handle set. This model demonstrates what the final assembly should look like.
* TMMH-006 is a model that contains every component needed to build one complete handle set arranged for optimum printability.

# Notes
* For a 3 axis Taig CNC Milling Maching you will require 3 complete sets of handles.
* This handle design does not fit on the Taig 4th axis rotary table.
